**Reflection Question #8. Does this work tell a story?** 
*The work tells the story of collections as critical constructions for simulating real-world problem-solving and multiple elements of data must often be addressed as a single reference or identifier in real-world problems. A first-in, first-out (FIFO) queue is a collection of processed components in a particular order. The first item in the column should be the first item processed, and hence the first item removed from the queue. A stack is almost the inverse of a FIFO queue in that the last item in the stack is processed first and removed from the line first. A dictionary is a collection of items that may be accessed using a key such as a person's name, and the value of a phone number or an email address. It utilize the key to access the data, and any given key will have a unique value linked with a queue if it exists. A contact application on the phone is a simple example of a dictionary. Arrays contain several things, but they are distinct in that we anticipate collections to be of the same data type and more typically associated with numerical data. An array's access or the processing is controlled by its index.* 

*Understanding of any given collection/array of data analytics data types.*
*1. Locate a reliable source of information.* 
*2. Go through the Beginner's Guide and Tutorials.* 
*3. Open the Hello World app, and 4. Instead of reading, learn by doing.*
*The four phases will ensure that we have a fundamental understanding of the code (steps 1 and 2) and a basic understanding of how to write it (steps 3 and 4).*

**2 Lab content- Inward Looking** 
**Reflection Question #13. Did you meet your standards?** 
*Our team communicates with each other dynamically and enables us to have the same mindset to work out the lab tasks which meets my standards and enables us to achieve and overcome the lab tasks.* 

**3 Assignment overall - Outward Looking** 
**Reflection Question #25. What grade would you give it? Why?** 
*I will give our project two prototypes grade as an A since we have managed to draw the prototype concise and simple in order for the target user to feel easy and enjoyable to use it. There are three points that I can judge the assignment to be graded A which are the consideration of colors, buttons, and graphical features for the app.*

*1.Color feature*
*The consistency of using the colors purple, white and black creates the platform to be clear and simple to highlight the essential information. It also provides the subconscious connection between a company’s customer services and its color scheme in order to help us (the users) easily recognize the information and feel the enjoyment scientifically. Moreover, showing the information using consist one color pleases the user's eye and attracts them to use it more daily. Furthermore, giving the option of choosing the color appeals to the app to be more enjoyable and entertaining and result to have a positive impression to use and see it.*

*We have chosen the primary application color to be purple as it constantly strives for more competency and self-improvement, which leads the users to be disciplined in setting out time and space for regular exercise. Purples are scientifically visualized as rigid, growth comfort, and enjoy completing, thereby using purple as a primary color can achieve the purpose of the exercise journal app and enables to drive the users to improve and have a better healthy lifestyle.*

*2.Buttons feature*
*A clear list of workout names, methods, and pictures by clicking the button to check and can save the details in the schedule elevates their exercise which enables to increase the users’ satisfaction. The convenience of keeping tracking the information by only clicking one button empowers users to have immediate work actions which increase their workout efficiency.*

*3.Graphical feature*
*The simplicity of showing the track of their body health through pie charts and bar charts allows the users to have a clear and faster recognition of the effort of their workouts and the improvements of their daily exercises as opposed to text or messages. The easy understanding of tracking their body health through visual representation strengthens a healthy lifestyle by observing accurate information on time. This enables them to organize their and increases workout routines efficiency.*

*Overall, the three vital attractive app features allow the users to manage their workouts efficiently by comprehending the information smoothly.*

**4 Course overall - Forward Looking** 
**Reflection Question #31. One thing I would like to improve upon is ...**
*Recently, the timezone has been changed so I need to change my schedule and manage to improve the attendance in live lectures since it was hard for me to catch up with the time difference this week.*
